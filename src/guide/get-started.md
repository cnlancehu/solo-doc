## Prerequisites
First, make sure that Solo supports your cloud provider.

Currently, Solo supports:

|   Provider    |                      Products                      |
| :-----------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
| Tencent Cloud |         Cloud Virtual Machine, Lighthouse          |
|    Aliyun     | Elastic Compute Service, Simple Application Server |

::: important
Solo is still in early development and currently supports only a limited number of products.

If you need support for other products and can provide a testing environment,

please contact us by [submitting an Issue](https://github.com/cnlancehu/solo/issues).

## Download
Go to the [download page](../download/README.md) to get the version suitable for your device.

::: tip Solo supports Android?!
Yes, Solo supports Android devices, but only at a very basic level.

Note that the Android version of Solo available for download **is not an apk â€” it's still a command-line program**.

To use Solo on Android, you'll need to run it using adb or root.

This is quite troublesome and is only for people who like to tinker with Android.
